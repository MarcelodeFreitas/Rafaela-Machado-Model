# Rafaela Machado Model Preparation for FMdeploy

This GitHub repository contains the code for adapting the "Environmental Sounds Automatic Classification" model developed by R. Machado, as presented in the dissertation submitted to the University of Minho in 2021.

The purpose of this adaptation is to integrate the original model with FMdeploy, a machine learning model deployment framework. By adapting the model code and configuration, it can be seamlessly deployed and utilized within the FMdeploy ecosystem.
